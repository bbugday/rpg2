Hey, are you Kawa?
Kawa: Yes, you want to train with us?
*I'm here to ask some questions. [] Can you help me?
*Maybe later. [] I have some questions for you. 
*I have more important things to do [] and I need your help. Can you answer a few questions?
-Kawa: What are these questions?
Mick told me that you could help me find the spots where the creatures spawn.
Kawa: I hear voices from time to time near the monument and the well to the west of the village. They don't take me seriously because no one else has heard them, but it's still worth investigating.
