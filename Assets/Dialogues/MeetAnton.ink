Hey! Are you Anton?
Anton: Oh, you must be that adventurer. I heard about your achievement, congratulations.
Thanks, Mick send me here. I need information for other creature points. 
Anton: Unfortunately, I don't know the exact point either. But there are some remains of bodies and bones north-east of here. If you examine them, you might find a clue.
Thanks, I'll take a look.
Anton: Good luck.
